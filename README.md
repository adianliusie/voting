# Bot-Set-Up for MAC

### Download Google Chrome
If chrome is not already installed on the computer, download [chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/) and open it 

### Installing python3
- This can be easily done using conda. First download [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Ensure that the version of miniconda is compatabile with the machine (i.e. x86/M1).

- Install Miniconda by opening terminal, going to Downloads and then installing the software on terminal (following the terminal instructions)

  ```
  cd ~/Downloads
  bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh 
  ```  
  *the second line is for non-m1 chip, for m1 chip use ```bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh ```

- close and reopen terminal. If conda is sucessfully installed one should see ```(base)``` on each line of terminal. To check if python3 has been sucesfully installed, run ```python --version``` and ensure the version is python3.*

### Installing python dependencies
A few python packages are necessary. Run the following 2 lines in terminal to get relevant dependencies:

```
pip install selenium==3.9
pip install numpy
```

### Downloading chromedriver

Download the [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=104.0.5112.79/) used by selenium. Again, ensure the compatible version is used. When the file is downloaded, open the .zip file on finder to unzip the file, then open terminal and run the following command

```
cd ~/Downloads
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin 
```

you will have to type the password on terminal (note characters won't show, but click enter when done anyways)

### Setting up Source code
first download the code base by cloning this repo

``` 
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/adianliusie/voting
```

Then move the `run` file to be easily accessible from the home directory
``` 
mv voting/run ~
```

Then try running the script
```
cd ~
bash run
```

This won't work due to security preferences. Open System Preference > Security & Privacy > General, and then allow using the chromedriver

Script should now work if on terminal you type ```bash run```!
